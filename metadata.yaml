description: "Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection with Some\
  \ of Its Applications is an 1889 book on biological evolution by Alfred Russel Wallace,\
  \ the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection together with Charles Darwin.\
  \ This was a book Wallace wrote as a defensive response to the scientific critics\
  \ of natural selection. Of all Wallace's books, it is cited by scholarly publications\
  \ the most.\nIn the preface to Darwinism, Wallace had used the term pure-Darwinism\
  \ which proposed a \"greater efficacy\" for natural selection. The book is notable\
  \ for defending August Weismann's theory of heredity and rejecting the inheritance\
  \ of acquired characteristics and the concept of sexual selection which Darwin gave\
  \ credence to. George Romanes dubbed this view as \"Wallaceism\", noting that in\
  \ contrast to Darwin, this position was advocating a \"pure theory of natural selection\
  \ to the exclusion of any supplementary theory.\" The book is seen as laying the\
  \ foundation for the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
